RUST + OXYGEN = OXIDE

A small, educational, multithreaded HTTP/1.1 server written from scratch in Rust. It implements routing, persistent (keep-alive) connections, gzip compression, graceful connection handling, and a custom thread pool for concurrency. The project is designed to be lightweight and easy to extend.

## Features

- Multithreaded architecture using a custom thread pool
- Persistent connections (HTTP/1.1 keep-alive)
- Simple router with support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Optional gzip compression for responses when supported by the client
- Clean, modular code separating HTTP parsing, routing, and server logic
- Graceful connection closure and timeout handling
- Tested with common tools such as curl

## Project structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ http/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ method.rs        # HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ request.rs       # HTTP request parsing

```

## How it works

1. Listen for incoming TCP connections on a configured port.
2. Each connection is handed to a worker from the thread pool.
3. The server parses HTTP/1.1 requests, matches routes, and generates responses.
4. Responses may be gzip-compressed when the client accepts it.
5. Connections are kept alive when requested and closed gracefully on timeout or client request.

## Run locally

Clone the repository and run with Cargo:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Yeabsirashimelis/oxide-http1.1.git
cd oxide-http1.1
cargo run
```

The server listens on the configured port (for example, 4221 by default in examples). Use curl or your browser to test endpoints.

### Example curl commands

GET requests

```powershell
curl -v http://localhost:4221/
curl -v http://localhost:4221/about
curl -v http://localhost:4221/user/42
```

POST, PUT, DELETE

```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:4221/user -d "name=dude-finetuner"
curl -X PUT http://localhost:4221/user/42 -d "name=dude-bsre"
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4221/user/42
```

Gzip compression

```powershell
curl -v --compressed http://localhost:4221/
```

Persistent connections (HTTP/1.1)

```powershell
curl -v --http1.1 http://localhost:4221/
```

## Learning goals

This project demonstrates:

- Low-level TCP handling in Rust
- HTTP request/response parsing
- Designing a thread pool for concurrency
- Connection persistence and graceful shutdown
- Compression and header management
- Simple routing with dynamic parameters

## Future improvements

- Add middleware support and static file serving
- Implement request pipelining and async I/O (e.g. using Tokio)
- Improve router capabilities (better parameter parsing, middleware, etc.)
