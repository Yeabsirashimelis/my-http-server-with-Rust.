an HTTP request is made up of three parts, each separated by a CRLF (\r\n)
 1, request line
 2, zero or more headers, each ending with a CRLF 
 3, optional request body


 pub struct BufReader<R> {
    // ...
}

impl<R: Read> BufReader<R> {
    pub fn new(inner: R) -> BufReader<R>
}
R can be any type that implements std::io::Read.
    Common examples:
    TcpStream → for reading network data
    File → for reading from files
    &[u8] → reading from in-memory byte slices
    Vec<u8> → reading from a vector
